# PiPianoBooster

This project is a fork of the PianoBooster Project by Louis B. at http://pianobooster.sourceforge.net/. 

The software is intended to be used with a Raspberry Pi 3b (or any Raspberry Pi capable of playing OpenGL) to create a dedicated device for playing Pianobooster. 

It is a practicing aid for beginner to intermediate students of piano.

It incorporates bits of code from two sources:
Base Code from Louis B
Note color-coding from Kory at sourceforge.

## History of Piano Booster.

The project was created by Louis B. He seems to have abandoned the project. In reading the Pianobooster forums, it appears he ran out of steam when considering a new interface for the application. Perhaps he reasoned that other music software's interfaces were better. I disagree.

"Kory" added code that colorizes the notes. I had trouble integrating the colorizing code and reached out to ALE (Alanta Linux Enthusiasts) and Decatur Makers for assistants. Horkan Smith and Ed Cashan responded and (IIRC) Horkan incorporated Koryâ€™s revised Draw.ccp file here:

Ed verified the changes and placed the code on his github https://github.com/ecashin/pianobory.
